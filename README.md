# What I Learned

* Use Javascript to create pop-ups like the "Subscribe to our Newsletter" modal that pops up a few seconds after the page has loaded.
* Use Javascript to manipulate the "transform" and "transition" properties and create fade-in animations for some of the elements on my page.
* Use the scroll event in Javascript to run functions at a certain scrolling height on the page.
* Use other event listeners like "click", "submit", and "load" to add interactivity to the page, and creating a "hamburger" menu for the mobile viewport.
* Use Google Font API to integrate more font styles into my CSS file
